* Clojure for Node for Max
** Introduction

These are the first steps towards booting up ClojureScript inside Node for Max, including a network REPL so that we can live-code through Node.js into the Max world.

** Setup

- To start, pure Node.js - no Max involvement yet
- Following instructions: [[https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2017-05-02-nodejs-scripts-clojurescript]] - the Node.js section

** Compile and Run: First Shot

- =project.clj= is set up to compile from =src-cljs= into =package/index.js=
- Compile using =lein cljsbuild once=
- Run with =node package/index.js=
- To avoid confusion, we've removed the =src= directory used by default for (Java) Clojure source
